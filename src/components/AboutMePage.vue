        <p>I am currently completing my senior year at Carleton College in Minnesota, although I am a Massachusetts native.
          More text will go here when I feel narcissistic and alive enough to write about myself.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>In this paragraph I will probably talk about my career goals/personal statement. 
          eg ux/ui design and accessibility as well as making computer science a more accessible and 
          open field, particularly for gender and racial minorities because i'm tired of white men
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>I'll probably wrap up here by talking about my hobbies (aka frisbee and reading)
          and go into enough depth that the text lines up perfectly with the height of the image
